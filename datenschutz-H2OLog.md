Privacy Policy for Water Tracker App

Last Updated: December 1, 2025

Thank you for using Water Tracker. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your personal information when you use our mobile application ("App").

1. Information We Collect

The Water Tracker App is designed to help you monitor your daily water intake. To provide this service, we collect and store the following information locally on your device:

Water Intake Logs: We record the amount of water you log, along with the date and precise timestamp (e.g., 2025-12-01 14:30:22) for each entry.
User Settings: We store your personalized settings, including:
Daily water goal (in ml or oz).
Preferred unit of measurement (ml or oz).
Maximum daily total limit.
Quick-add values (e.g., 250, 500, 750 ml).
Timer Data: If you use the timer feature, we temporarily store the end time of the active timer on your device to restore it if you close and reopen the app.
Exported Data: When you choose to export your data, the app generates a CSV file containing your logs and statistics. This file is created locally and shared directly through your device's native sharing system (e.g., email, messaging apps). The app does not retain a copy of this exported file.
2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information described above solely for the purpose of providing and improving the core functionality of the Water Tracker App on your device. Specifically, we use your data to:

Display your current daily intake progress against your goal.
Show your historical water consumption in the "History" section.
Calculate and display statistics such as your 7-day and 30-day averages, and your current streak.
Allow you to edit or delete individual water intake entries.
Save your preferences so they persist between app sessions.
Manage the timer functionality.
Generate and facilitate the export of your data upon your request.
3. Data Storage and Security

Local Storage Only: All your personal data (water logs, settings, timer state) is stored exclusively on your personal device. It is saved using the @react-native-async-storage/async-storage library and a local SQLite database (./components/dbank). Your data is never transmitted to or stored on any external servers or cloud services operated by us or any third party.
No External Tracking: The app does not contain any analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs (like Google Analytics, Facebook SDK, etc.). We do not collect usage data, device identifiers, or location information.
Security Measures: While the app itself does not implement complex encryption for local data, the security of your data ultimately depends on the security features of your own device (e.g., screen lock, device encryption).
4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not share, sell, rent, or otherwise disclose your personal information to any third parties. Since all data is stored locally, there is no mechanism for us to access or transfer it.

5. Data Export and Deletion

Export: You can export your complete water intake history and statistics at any time via the "Export Data" feature in the Settings screen. The app will generate a CSV file that you can then share or save using your device's standard sharing options.
Deletion: You can permanently delete all your data from the app by selecting "Clear All Data" in the Settings screen. This action will remove all water logs, settings, and timer data from your device. This action cannot be undone.
6. Children's Privacy

The Water Tracker App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe that we might have collected such information, please contact us immediately.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app or on this page, and the "Last Updated" date at the top will be revised. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.

8. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: abdullahbssn@gmail.com

This policy clearly communicates that the app is a local, offline tool and emphasizes the lack of data transmission to external servers, which is the most critical point for user privacy in this context.
