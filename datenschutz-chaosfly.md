1. Introduction
Welcome to ChaosFly! This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use our mobile game application. We are committed to protecting your personal data and respecting your privacy rights. 

This Privacy Policy applies to all users of the ChaosFly mobile game on iOS and Android platforms. By using our game, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

2. Information We Collect
2.1. No Personal Data Collection
ChaosFly is designed as an offline game that does not collect any personal information from users. We do not require users to provide personal details such as:

Name
Email address
Phone number
Physical address
Payment information
Social media accounts
2.2. Local Game Data
The game uses local storage (via expo-sqlite) to save game progress, scores, and preferences directly on your device. 
 This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any servers or third parties.

2.3. Device Information
The game may collect non-personal, technical information about your device for functionality purposes, such as:

Device model and operating system version
Screen resolution and orientation
Storage capacity for game assets
This information is used solely to ensure proper game functionality and is not personally identifiable.

3. Children's Privacy
ChaosFly is designed for general audiences and may be suitable for children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or 16 in the EU). 

Since our game does not collect any personal data or connect to external servers, it is inherently COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) compliant. 
 Parents can be assured that their children's information is not being collected, stored, or shared with third parties.

4. Data Usage and Sharing
4.1. No Data Sharing
We do not share, sell, rent, or disclose any user information to third parties because we do not collect any personal data from users. 

4.2. Third-Party Services
This game does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising networks, or social media platforms that might collect user data. There are no external SDKs or APIs that transmit user information.

4.3. Local Data Storage
All game data (scores, progress, settings) is stored locally on your device using SQLite database technology. 
 This data remains entirely on your device and is only accessible through the game application itself.

5. Data Security
While we do not collect personal data, we take reasonable measures to protect the local game data stored on your device:

Game data is stored in encrypted format where possible
No external network connections are made that could compromise local data
Regular security updates are provided through app store updates
6. User Rights
Since we do not collect personal data, most data protection rights do not apply. However, you have the following rights regarding your local game data:

Access: You can view your game progress and scores within the game
Deletion: You can delete all local game data by uninstalling the application or using the "Reset Game" option if available
Portability: Game data is stored locally and cannot be transferred between devices
7. International Data Transfers
No data is transferred internationally because no user data is collected or stored on external servers. All data remains on your local device. 

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here with an updated "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any changes.

Since ChaosFly does not collect personal data, it inherently meets the core requirements of these regulations regarding data minimization and user privacy protection.
