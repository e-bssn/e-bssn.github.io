Privacy Policy for Color Picker App

Last Updated: November 26, 2025

This Privacy Policy is designed to inform you about our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our mobile application ("App").

1. Zero Data Collection

The Color Picker App does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data, usage metrics, or anonymous identifiers.

The App is a fully standalone, offline utility. All operations, including color selection, conversion, and preference saving (if any), occur locally on your device. We do not use any servers, analytics tools (like Google Analytics or Firebase Analytics), or tracking technologies.

2. Local Device Feature Usage

The App interacts with your device's features only to enhance the user experience, but these interactions are strictly local and transient:

Clipboard (expo-clipboard): Used to copy selected color values (HEX, RGB, etc.) to your device's clipboard when you tap the copy icon. This action is entirely local.

Haptics (expo-haptics): Used to provide haptic (vibrational) feedback during color selection and button presses. This is a local device function.

Color Scheme (useColorScheme): Used to detect whether your device is set to Light Mode or Dark Mode, allowing the App's theme to adjust automatically. This preference remains on your device.

3. Expo and Third-Party Modules

The App is built using React Native and the Expo framework. We utilize standard, self-contained modules provided by Expo. These modules run locally on your device and are not configured by us to transmit any data to external servers.

4. Children’s Privacy

Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. Given that the App operates on a principle of zero data collection, we do not knowingly collect, store, or process any personal information from users of any age.

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy here and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
