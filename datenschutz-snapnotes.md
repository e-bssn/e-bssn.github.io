We understand that privacy is important to you, and we are committed to protecting your personal data. This policy describes what information SnapNotes collects, how it is used, and your rights regarding your data.

2. Information We Collect
SnapNotes is designed as a completely local, offline-first application that does not require an internet connection to function. We do not collect or transmit any of your personal data to external servers or third parties.

The only information stored by SnapNotes is:

Your Notes: The content you create, including titles, text content, timestamps, and categories
Category Information: Names and colors of categories you create

To allow exporting your notes in CSV format
Your data is never shared with third parties, never transmitted to remote servers, and never used for advertising or analytics purposes.

All data is stored locally on your device using the device's secure storage system. No information leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to export your notes.

Password Protection
If you enable password protection:

Your password is stored locally in an encrypted format
The password is only used to encrypt/decrypt access to your notes
We do not have access to your password or your encrypted data
Export Functionality
When you choose to export your notes:

The app creates a CSV file containing your notes
This file is saved to your device's storage
You control when and where this file is shared
No data is automatically transmitted when exporting
5. Data Retention
Your notes and data remain on your device until you:

Manually delete individual notes
